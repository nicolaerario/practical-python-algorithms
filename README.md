# Practical algorithms written in :snake: Python

This repo is aimed at anyone who knows the basics of coding and want to have examples on some useful algorithms.

Maybe if you have a coding problem, you can try to find here an algorithmic solution.

All the examples are written in Python, but can be adapted to any programming language.
